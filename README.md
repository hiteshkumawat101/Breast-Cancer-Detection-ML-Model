# Breast-Cancer-Detection-ML-Model
This project uses logistic regression to predict the presence of breast cancer based on a dataset. The model classifies tumors as malignant or benign.
The training accuracy score(98%) indicates how well the model performs on the training data, 
while the test accuracy score(96% )provides an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.
